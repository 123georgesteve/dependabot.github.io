Want to keep your application as secure as possible? According to the last 10
years of Rubysec data, the most secure, actionable strategy is to keep your
dependencies on the bleeding edge, even before a vulnerability is disclosed.

### Competing strategies

Let’s consider three competing strategies for dependency management:

1. Always up-to-date: Use the latest version at all times. “It may be raw, but
   I want the fixes and new features as soon as possible.”
2. Late adopter: Wait a month before upgrading to new major or minor versions.
   “Older versions are tried and tested.”
3. Reactive: Upgrade as-and-when there’s a security vulnerability or business
   need. “Proactive dependency management is busy-work.”

I’ve heard arguments made for all three of the above. Let’s confront them with
the data.

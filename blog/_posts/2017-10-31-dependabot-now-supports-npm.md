Using npm for your JavaScript dependencies? Dependabot can now help you keep
your `package-lock.json` up-to-date.

<p class="image-medium">

To get started, just click the "Add project" button and select the repo
you'd like to automate updates for. Select "JavaScript (npm, beta)" from the
list of languages, and click "Add".

Using Yarn instead? No problem - we've been supporting Yarn since May!

We're constantly working to improve Dependabot - if you have any suggestions
please don't hesitate to [let us know][feedback-link]!

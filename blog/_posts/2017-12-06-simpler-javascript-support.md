We've just made Dependabot much easier to use with JavaScript:
- **No lockfile required:** You can now use Dependabot on JavaScript projects
  that don't have a lockfile. We'll bump the requirements in your `package.json`
  to ensure they always cover the latest version
- **Automatic lockfile detection:** Dependabot will figure out if you're using
  Yarn or npm (or both, or neither) automatically. No need to tell it when you
  get setup, or if you switch
- **Yarn Workspaces support:** If you're working on a JavaScript monorepo then
  you might have heard of [Yarn Workspaces][yarn-workspaces]. Dependabot now
  supports them, so you can keep your entire monorepo up-to-date easily

We're also excited to announce that our 5,000th JavaScript PR was merged
yesterday, so we must have been doing something right already.

We'll keep shipping updates to Dependabot's JavaScript support, and love hearing
your feedback. If there's something you'd like to see Dependabot support,
[let us know][feedback-link]!

Enjoy!
